# Docker Compose Override for Linux Servers
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is for LINUX SERVERS ONLY!
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. On your Linux server, copy this file:
#    cp docker-compose.linux.yml docker-compose.override.yml
#
# 2. Docker Compose will automatically use it alongside docker-compose.yml
#
# 3. On Windows, do NOT create docker-compose.override.yml
#    (it's in .gitignore so it won't be committed)

version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    # Run container as UID 1000 to match typical Linux user
    # This fixes file permission issues on Linux hosts
